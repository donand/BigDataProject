# Predictive model for event attendance during "Salone Internazionale del Mobile" 2016 in Milan

The "Salone Internazionale del Mobile" is an annual design event that takes place in Milan and lasts for one week. During this week there are a lot of events and exhibitions all around the city.

We performed an analysis on data coming from Salone del Mobile, Fuori Salone mobile App and one of the main telecommunication companies in Italy in order to find interesting patterns and trends, like most important areas or events and people movements.

Finally we developed a model for predicting the attendance at the events during the week.

This project was developed for the Big Data Course at Politecnico di Milano.
